# San Diego Top Spots

## Introduction

In this project, we will be building a small informational website containing a list of 30 "top places to see" in San Diego, which we will refer to as "Top Spots". 

To accomplish this, we will need to:

1. Include CSS styling provided by Bootstrap
2. Create a container component to manage application state.
3. Create a presentational component to render a single top spot. 
4. Render a collection of Top Spots in the container component.

## Getting Started
1. Open a terminal
1. Clone your starter files from [Github](https://github.com/SanDiegoCodeSchool/react100-san-diego-top-spots) and open the project in VS code.
1. Run: `npm install` to install all the dependencies.
1. As you add code to the project, you will want to view your progress in a browser. To do this, first type `npm run build` to compile your project. Then, type `npm start` to launch your project on a local webserver. In your console window, you should see the output `Server is listening on port 3000`. Open a browser to the url, `http://localhost:3000/` to render the project and view your progress.
1. The tests will confirm if you have completed the requirements. Type `npm test` and hit enter to run the tests. Then, write your code using the steps below. When you have written all the code to complete the project (based on the exit criteria) and the tests are passing, submit the assignment.

## Step 1 - Include CSS styling provided by Bootstrap.

This project uses Bootstrap for styling. Find Bootstrap on [cdnjs.com](http://cdnjs.com) and paste the `<link>` tag in the correct place within `/public/index.html`.

## Step 2 - Create a container component.
Now that Bootstrap is in place, the first file we are going to focus our efforts on is `/src/app.jsx`. Complete the tasks below and then move on to the next section.

**Add elements to match the provided screenshot**

In the `render` method of `/src/app.jsx`, go ahead and write the necessary JSX to render the following wireframe:

Next, we need to render the 30 "top spots". Now, we could simply type up each one in JSX, but that's difficult to maintain over time. Instead - let's load the data from an external web service and use a loop to render a template for each iteration.

First, let's checkout the web service and the data it exposes:

Click on this link to have your browser do a GET request to the api: [https://codepen.io/merobertsjr/pen/WayqqB.js](https://codepen.io/merobertsjr/pen/WayqqB.js)

Note: Don't worry about he `js` file extention on the url, we are just using a little hack to have the api hosted easily via [Code Pen](https://codepen.io).

The JSON returned from that URL contains an _array_ of _objects_, where each object contains the following properties:

```json
{
    "name": "Name of the top spot",
    "description": "Some words about the top spot",
    "location": [
        32.122843,
        -127.124844
    ]
}
```

The `name` and `description` fields are self descriptive, the tricky one here is the `location` property - which contains an array of two values representing the **latitude** and **longitude** co-ordinates (or location) of that top spot. We'll eventually use these to generate a link that'll take the user to Google Maps and place a pin at that location.

> You can do a lot with lat/long values, such as plotting positions on a Google Map or calculating the most efficient route through a set of lat/long pairs.

To download this data in our React app, first we'll need to set a few things up in the App component.

### 

In `/src/app.jsx`, add a [constructor](https://babeljs.io/blog/2015/06/07/react-on-es6-plus) to the `App` class as follows:

```jsx
export default class App extends Component {
    constructor(props) {
        super(props);

        this.state = {
            topspots: []
        };
    }
}
```

This sets up a function that will be among the first invoked when the App component is first instantiated for mounting to the DOM. `props` and `super(props)` are mostly there for boilerplate, the main reason we created this constructor is the assigning of an initial [state]() object to `this.state`, which contains the array where we will store the data structure returned by our web service.

Now that we have setup a mechanism for storing our data - let's write the code to actually go get it.

Before we continue - we're going to need to grab a package from `npm` called `axios`. Take a few minutes to checkout their [README.md](https://github.com/mzabriskie/axios) to see what it does.

Essentially, `axios` is a promise-based HTTP client that you can program in NodeJS. We will use it to make a `GET` request to the URL specified earlier, then use the data returned in the response to map out that data into pretty-looking React components.

Go ahead and install `axios` into the project, then add a `componentWillMount` [Lifecycle Hook](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/react-component.html#componentwillmount) to `/src/app.jsx`.

```bash
$ npm install axios --save
``` 

```js
export class App extends Component {
    constructor(props) {
        super(props);

        this.state = {
            topspots: []
        }
    }

    componentWillMount() {

    }
}
```

> You may opt to add the following code to the `constructor()` function [as per the specifications](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/react-component.html#componentwillmount) in the latest version of the React documentation.

Next, add the following code to your `componentWillMount` function to tell React to make an HTTP GET request to our external web service when the component is about to be mounted to the DOM.

```js
axios
    .get('https://origin-top-spots-api.herokuapp.com/api/topspots')
    .then(response => response.data)
    .then(topspots => this.setState({ topspots }));
```

Let's destruct this code a little bit to understand what it's doing.

```js
// Here we're simply invoking the axios object, specifically.. 
axios
    
    // .. the .get function. Here we pass the URL of our external service.
    .get('https://origin-top-spots-api.herokuapp.com/api/topspots')

    // Here the first fulfill callback is setup.
    // This callback simply takes an HTTP response and returns the data property..
    .then(response => response.data) 
    
    // .. to the second fulfill callback, which uses React's this.setState
    // function to merge the provided object (which uses ES6 shorthand)
    // with the current object assigned to this.state (which you assigned 
    // in your constructor!)
    .then(topspots => this.setState({ topspots }));
```

To end this step, let's do a quick test to see that the data is being downloaded successfully. Add the following JSX to the `render()` method of `/src/app.jsx`.

```jsx
<pre>{ JSON.stringify(this.state.topspots, null, 2) }</pre>
```

> To see where that JSON.stringify code came from, see [this Stack Overflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4810841/how-can-i-pretty-print-json-using-javascript) which has become a standard solution for this problem.

You should now be able to run the app by running `npm run start` to launch a web server to host this application and opening [`http://localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

If everything goes according to plan - you should be presented with the following webpage:

Great stuff! The data lives in our component, now we're ready to use the data to map out a more human readable version of that object array. Take some time to understand the data structure, then proceed to Step 3.

## Step 3 - Create a presentational component.

Now that our container component has done it's job of managing application state by downloading data at the right time, it's time to create a quick presentational component to turn our data into something more visual. 

Create a new file called `topspot.jsx` in `/src` and add the following code to get started.

```js
import React from 'react';

export default props => (
    
);
```

This is the basis of a stateless component in React. What follows is a compiled list of resources that discuss stateless components. You should take some time to read each one to gain understanding of why the project is setup this way.

- [Functional Stateless Components in React](https://javascriptplayground.com/blog/2017/03/functional-stateless-components-react/)
- [React Stateless Functional Components: Nine Wins You Might Have Overlooked](https://hackernoon.com/react-stateless-functional-components-nine-wins-you-might-have-overlooked-997b0d933dbc)
- [React Documentation](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/components-and-props.html)

For this stateless component, we shall assume that the props being passed to this function are: `props.name`, `props.description` and `props.location[0]`/`props.location[1]`.

Given these props, we can render the following JSX markup inside the ES6 function we created in `topspot.jsx`.

```jsx
<div className='well'>
    <h4>{props.name}</h4>
    <p>{props.description}</p>
</div>
```

## Step 4 - Render a collection of Top Spots in the container component.

We're now ready to step back into our container component (`app.jsx`) to map out the array into a collection of the presentational component we just created.

> Before continuing - it will be **immensely** helpful to spend some time brushing up on how the `.map()` function works and making it stick by going over it with a classmate/instructor. While it is used heavily in React to generate a list of components, it's functionality is broad and applicable to a number of programming scenarios.

First, import your presentational component by adding the following to the beginning of `app.jsx`.

```js
import TopSpot from './topspot';
```

Then, add this code to the `render()` method of `app.jsx` below the jumbotron you created earlier.

```js
{ 
    this.state.topspots.map(topspot => (
        <TopSpot
            key={topspot.id}
            name={topspot.name}
            description={topspot.description}
            location={topspot.location} />
    ))
}
```

Once you have added that code to the correct spot in your `render` function - you should be able to see the following when you start the application:

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/RjkEukP.png" >

All that's left is to add a button to each top spot that redirects the user to the following URL (swapping `{lat}` and `{lon}` for their real values).

```
https://maps.google.com/?q={lat},{lon}
```

You've got it from this point - use everything you've learned, utilizing the web and your classmates/instructors when you get stuck.

Don't forget - you need to make the provided unit tests pass in order to submit the project and continue to the next project.

## Bonus

* Add distance (in miles) from current location to each result.
* Add hover effect over each row in the table that will display an image or some other interesting info about the top spot.

## Project Submission
